   Our project is a math program designed for 1st-4th graders.
   given the options to do additions questions and subtraction questions.
   each grade has a different range of numbers that can be radnomly chosen for their questions.
   4th graders have the options to do multiplication and division from numbers ranging 0-10
   an array keeps track of the top 5 high scores, and the names of those users  */
